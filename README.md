# NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8.
